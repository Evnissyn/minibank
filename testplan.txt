1) Makefile commands:
	"make server"	Use this on iLabs to create server.exe
	"make client"	Use this on iLabs to create client.exe

	"make s"	Use this on Cygwin, cygwin doesn't understand -pthread
	"make c"	Use this on Cygwin, cygwin doesn't understand -pthread

	client.exe only needs client.c and client.h
	all other files belong to server.exe

2) printing the bank:
	The server process starts up a new thread to print the entire bank 
	every 20 seconds.  This is even before the server starts accepting
	connections. This is what the bank looks like in the beginning:

		Printing bank ... 0 open accounts
		NUM     ACCOUNT NAME    BALANCE IN USE?
		0       <empty>         <0>             <N/A>
		1       <empty>         <0>             <N/A>
		2       <empty>         <0>             <N/A>
		3       <empty>         <0>             <N/A>
		4       <empty>         <0>             <N/A>
		5       <empty>         <0>             <N/A>
		6       <empty>         <0>             <N/A>
		7       <empty>         <0>             <N/A>
		8       <empty>         <0>             <N/A>
		9       <empty>         <0>             <N/A>
		10      <empty>         <0>             <N/A>
		11      <empty>         <0>             <N/A>
		12      <empty>         <0>             <N/A>
		13      <empty>         <0>             <N/A>
		14      <empty>         <0>             <N/A>
		15      <empty>         <0>             <N/A>
		16      <empty>         <0>             <N/A>
		17      <empty>         <0>             <N/A>
		18      <empty>         <0>             <N/A>
		19      <empty>         <0>             <N/A>

	As connections occur and clients start creating and adjusting
	accounts, the bank will change.

3) Client interface:
	When the client process connects to the server socket, the 
	first thing the server does to send over a welcome message:

		Welcome to the Desert Sands Banking Platform
		What would you like to do today?
		Would you like to
		        [open] a new account?
		        [start] a session with a preexisting account?

	The client process creates a thread read from the server, and
	this welcome message is the first thing read by this new thread
	and displayed on the client-user's screen.

	All the client-user's entered commands are read by the client
	process's original thread at the rate of command every two 
	seconds.  The server's interface thread prints out on its screen 
	every command as it is received, so it is possible to check the
	rate the client process sends its commands.

		USER SCREEN:			SERVER SCREEN:
		open cecil			INCOMING MESSAGE: [open]
		credit 20
		open carlos			INCOMING MESSAGE: [credit]
						INCOMING MESSAGE: [open]
		You are currently in 
		     a customer session
		Invalid command
		start oldwomanjosie		INCOMING MESSAGE: [start]
		Starting session with 
		     preexisting account 
		     failed

	The server will complain to the user about invalid commands,
	such as trying to open a new account or start a session with
	a preexisting account.
	
		finish				INCOMING MESSAGE: [finish]
		open carlos			INCOMING MESSAGE: [open]
		credit 70			INCOMING MESSAGE: [credit]
		balance				INCOMING MESSAGE: [balance]
		BALANCE: 70.000000
		debit 20
		balance				INCOMING MESSAGE: [debit]
		finish				INCOMING MESSAGE: [balance]
		BALANCE: 50.000000
		open oldwomanjosie		INCOMING MESSAGE: [finish]
		debit 60
		credit 20			INCOMING MESSAGE: [open]
		finish				INCOMING MESSAGE: [debit]
		Invalid transaction: not 
		     enough funds

	The server will also notify the user if the user is attempting
	to debit more money than the account holds.

						INCOMING MESSAGE: [credit]
						INCOMING MESSAGE: [finish]
						INCOMING MESSAGE: [start]

		start cecil
		balance
		BALANCE: 20.000000
		debit 20
		balance
		BALANCE: 0.000000
		close
		finish
		You are not currently in a customer session
		close
		You are not currently in a customer session
		exit

	Note: I added another command "close" to close out an account.

4) Printing the bank (again);

	Throughout the above interactions, the bank continues to 
	print a full accounting every 20 seconds:

Printing bank ... 2 open accounts
NUM     ACCOUNT NAME    BALANCE IN USE?
0       cecil   20.000000
1       carlos  50.000000
2       <empty>         <0>             <N/A>
3       <empty>         <0>             <N/A>
4       <empty>         <0>             <N/A>
